   <abstract>The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventoryᵀᴹ Version 4.0 Short Form Generic Core Scale (PedsQLᵀᴹ) is a validated and widely used tool assessing the quality of life (QoL) of children and youth. It has been used extensively across healthy populations as well as those with chronic and acute illnesses, allowing for comparison of the psychosocial impact of chronic illness between pediatric disease cohorts. As part of the QoL initiative undertaken at the British Columbia Children's Hospital (BCCH) Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) program and published in the Journal of Pediatrics titled “Cross-Sectional Analysis of Quality of Life in Pediatric Patients with IBD in British Columbia, Canada,” a limited literature review was conducted using Embasse and Ovid. Studies using the English version of the PedsQLᵀᴹ short form generic scale (not a disease specific scale) were identified. Studies with populations greater than 50 patients with robust subgroup sample size were included, with an emphasis on studies with well-defined patients with chronic disease. These data were compared to the BCCH population, as discussed in the aforementioned journal article. Analysis within the BCCH cohort is described separately. Comparison between different populations from the existing literature was qualitative only, with no statistical analysis done given the heterogeneity of populations and studies. In a study of patients from the emergency department at BCCH (n=178), the mean (SD) QoL scores of the healthy patients was 89.2 (10.3). In a group of self-identified healthy patients in California (n=5079), their mean QoL score was 83.9 (12.5). Separating the BCCH IBD population by disease activity, those in remission (n=220, 84.4 (12.8)) have similar QoL scores to these healthy cohorts, though their scores remain slightly below the previously published BCCH cohort. For children with any degree of active IBD (n=98, 75.6 (15.8)), their QoL scores are below the healthy means and are lower than other groups with self-identified “chronic illnesses” (n=367, 77.2 (15.5)), diabetes (n=418, 82.3 (13.5)), mild asthma (n=281, 85.5 (13.3)), or Canadian patients 4 weeks post-concussion (n=1157, 80.3). BCCH IBD patients with moderately to severely active disease have QoL scores well below the other disease groups (n=33, 63.1 (18.8)); lower than oncology patients on induction chemotherapy regimens (n=105, 68.9 (16.0)), acute inpatients (n=359, 63.9 (20.3)), and asthmatics with moderate-severe, persistent asthma (n=86, 67.1 (18.6)). This data is useful for clinicians treating pediatric patients looking at how QoL is influenced by chronic illness and by factors such as disease type and severity. </abstract>
