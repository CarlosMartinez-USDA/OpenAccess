   <abstract>Understanding the correlations between dietary fibers' physical properties and postprandial appetite response helps to design novel functional products with satiety enhancing capability. In the present study, the partially degraded konjac glucomannan (Pd-KGM) was obtained by applying the heterogeneous hygrothermal degradation method, and its flow behavior was studied for guiding the preparation of sols with equi-concentration but differed in viscosity. The appetite-regulating effects derived from the sol viscosity were explored by monitoring the appetite hormone response and the feeding behavior of rats after they were given the Pd-KGM sols. By lowering the secretion of ghrelin, elevating the plasma concentration of GLP-1, PYY₃–₃₆, and CCK-8, and stabilizing blood glucose and insulin fluctuation, the sol with increased viscosity showed an improved satiety-enhancing capability. Moreover, the transition point from feeding to resting was advanced in rats given a more viscous sol, resulting in a significantly decreased feed intake (p &lt; 0.05). We further explored the correlations between sol viscosity and its nutritional effects relating to appetite regulation depending on the quantitative data obtained in this study. Excluding the plasma glucose and CCK-8, a strong linear correlation (Pearson coefficient &gt; 0.7) emerged between the appetite hormone and the sol viscosity, especially for the GLP-1, which its Pearson coefficient was 0.946, indicating a very highly correlated relationship between them. Thus, these results revealed the feasibility of regulating appetite by taking advantage of sol viscosity. </abstract>
